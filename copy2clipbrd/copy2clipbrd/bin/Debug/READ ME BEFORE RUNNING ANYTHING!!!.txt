How to use:

1. Launch the RUN.bat file
   - The Copy2Clipbrd window will show up.

2. Choose your context menu preferences
   - Check all the options you want to show up in the right click file menu

3. Click the large switch to activate the service
   - After you do so, you can close the Copy2Clipboard window.


DISCLAIMER:
This program can be marked as a virus by certain antivirus software! This is because the contextmenu items are added by
modifying (just adding new, but still) registry keys, which is the thing that triggers anti-viruses.

I know this may be a dealbreaker for some users, and that's why we have a very detailed tutorials on how to build this from the source code itself! You can see the instructions on our github project page! (see link at the bottom)

====  IMPORTANT NOTES:  ======================================

	- After you activate the service, please dont change the location of the executables, the parent folder or any of 		the files within. If you want to move the location of Copy2clipboard files,
	you have to activate the service again after doing so. Preferably you can stop the service before moving the files, 	to avoid having empty entries in your registry, but again, this would be resolved any time you run the service 		again from any other location on your disk.

	- YOU CAN CHANGE THE .ICO and/or .PNG files contained inside the source folder to any you would want. You can 	retrieve the default resources by removing the modified ones, all the files will be re-generated on the next 	service refresh or activation.

	- This code is totally free to use! You can use this code freely to implement your own ideas, and build upon. All 	of the code is licensed under the DONT ASK license (https://piotrekunitydeveloper.github.io/dontask/), which allows 	you to do anything you want with the entire source code of this utility program. You're welcome to fork us! Sharing 	is caring, right?
